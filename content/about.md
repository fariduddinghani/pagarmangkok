**My methode to designing book cover design:** In designing book covers, I started by reading the script, then imagining the nuance, after that I just made a cover design. For me, this interpretation process is important in designing book covers. In addition to being not easily swept away in the current visual trend, it is also better able to bring the contents of the book closer to its readers.
