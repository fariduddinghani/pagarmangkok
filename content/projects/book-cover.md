The fun of the process of illustrating a poem is that I am more able to experiment with surreal symbols.

Verses of poetry that are not throughout the novel, provide its own challenges. Sometimes interpreting poetry into a visual artwork will be difficult for words that have connotative meaning in the context of the poetry sentence.
