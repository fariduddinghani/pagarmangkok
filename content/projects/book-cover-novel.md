In my opinion, the process of interpreting a novel to visual artwork is easier than a poetry. This is because a novel story has a long but interrelated setting in each chapter. The harmony between these stories makes the puzzle pieces in my imagination easy to assemble. Very different from a compilation of poetry books that tend to be separate between one poetry and another.
