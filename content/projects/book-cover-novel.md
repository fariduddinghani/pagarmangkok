title: Book Cover (Novel)
subtitle: >-
  In my opinion, the process of interpreting novels to visual artwork is easier
  than poetry. This is because a novel story has a long but interrelated setting
  in each chapter. The harmony between these stories makes the puzzle pieces in
  my imagination easy to assemble. Very different from a compilation of poetry
  books that tend to be separate between one poetry and another. ImageChoose
